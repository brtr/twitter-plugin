## X Token Price

### How to start using the X Token Price Chrome Extension

#### Install the X Token Price Chrome Extension
> Since version 75.x, Chrome requires Google's web store signature on extension files. This means that you can't install the extension by just downloading the files and dragging them into the `chrome://extensions` page. You can still install the extension manually by enabling developer mode in the `chrome://extensions` page and then clicking on the `Load unpacked` button. This will allow you to select the extension's folder and install it.

- Download the extension's files from the [releases page](https://github.com/brtr/twitter-plugin/releases/tag/v0.0.0.Beta)
- Unzip the files
- Open the `chrome://extensions` page
- Enable developer mode
- Click on the `Load unpacked` button
- Select the extension's folder, and click `Open` to install it

#### Get your own Coin Market Cap API Key
- You can sign up for a free Developer Portal account at [pro.coinmarketcap.com](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/) to get your own API key.
- Once you sign up you'll land on your Developer Portal account dashboard. Copy your API from the API Key box in the top left panel.

#### Set up the X Token Price Chrome Extension
- Click on the `X Token Price` extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
- Then paste your API Key, and click on the `Save` button.

#### Use the X Token Price Chrome Extension
- When you visit twitter.com, and when you hover over a price symbol like `$BTC`, you'll see a tooltip with the current price of Bitcoin.
